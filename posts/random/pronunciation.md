It's "thuh"-shaar and NOT "two"-shaar (or, "too"-shaar)!! (There's only one of me, I
think!) <br/>
Tushaar is pronounced as "Thuh-shaar," and Gangavarapu as "Gun-ga-vah-ra-pu":

<b>Thuh-shaar</b>

<p>
<ul>
    <li> "Thuh" sounds like the "thu" in "thunder" (the short "uh" vowel) and NOT like "two" or "too," and </li>
    <li> "shaar" rhymes with "shar" in "shark," but extend the "aa" just a touch (and drop the "k"). </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>

<b>Gun-ga-vah-ra-pu</b>

<p>
<ul>
    <li> "Gun" like "gun," </li>
    <li> "ga" like the "guh" in "gutter," minus the "tter," </li>
    <li> "vah" like the "vuh" in "vulture," </li>
    <li> "ra" like "ruh" in "runner," minus the "n," and </li>
    <li> "pu" like the "pu" in "put," minus the "t." </li>
</ul>
</p>

Here's an audio recording of "Tushaar Gangavarapu" pronounced three times using the
"Italian/Giorgio" voice from <a href="https://ttsmp3.com">ttsmp3.com</a>:

It's "thuh"-shaar and NOT "two"-shaar (or, "too"-shaar)!! (There's only one of me, I
think!) <br/>
Tushaar is pronounced as "Thuh-shaar," and Gangavarapu as "Gun-ga-vah-ra-poo":

<p>
**Thuh-shaar**

- "Thuh" sounds like the "thu" in "thunder" (the short "uh" vowel) and NOT like "two" or "too," and
- "shaar" rhymes with "shar" in "shark," but extend the "aa" just a touch (and drop the "k").

**Gun-ga-vah-ra-poo**

- "Gun" like "gun"
- "ga" like the "guh" in "gutter," minus the "tter"
- "vah" like the "vuh" in "vulture"
- "ra" like "ruh" in "runner," minus the "n"
- "poo" like the "pu" in "put," minus the "t"

Here's an audio recording of "Tushaar Gangavarapu" pronounced three times using the
"Italian/Giorgio" voice from <a href="https://ttsmp3.com">ttsmp3.com</a>:

[Yann Hicke](https://yannhicke.github.io/images/EscapeFromHappiness.JPG) wrote,

        <i>You</i> go to Cornell?

<p>And thus began one of the most profound philosophical exchanges of our time.</p>

In that email thread, Hicke didn't just ask me about my identity; he asked <i>the</i>
age-old question: <i>Who am I? Why do I exist?</i> Am I just a blip in the vast,
cosmic sprawl of Cornell's CS department, hidden away in the basement? I knew I had to
respond in kind. Well, no ordinary response would do. This was my moment, my moment to
some something ... bigger.
</p>

<p>
So, I took a deep breath, channeled my inner
[Jonathan (Chang)](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jpchang/), and replied:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 1.3; margin: 0;">
        You're the reason I live. You're my advisor, my god, my faith, and <br>
        my reason to think.
    </p>
</blockquote>

I wasn't just replying to an email. This was my <i>magnum opus</i>, the culmination of
my academic career, distilled into one email response, that said: <i>I am here, and it's
all because of you, Hicke.</i> Naturally, I wasn't done. I had to deliver my
<i>pièce de résistance</i>, and so I added:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 1.3; margin: 0;">
        <i>You</i> [Yann Hicke] think, therefore <i>I</i> [Tushaar Gangavarapu] am.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
After all, Descartes may have had his "<i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>," but did he ever say it
to an unsuspecting friend over email? I think not!! And just when I expected a hilarious
response (or a blatant insult), he wrote back with a humble request:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 1.3; margin: 0;">
        "Please add this to your website."
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So here we are! I present to you, dear reader, a testament to the power of random
email exchanges, the mysteries of identity, and the joy of completely over-the-top
responses—and of course, Yann Hicke!
